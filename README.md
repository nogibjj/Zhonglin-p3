# Zhonglin Project3 Microservice API Rust

## Key Objectives of Project
In project 3, I developped a microservice using wikipedia API on Rust. 

The project will ask users to input a term that he/she want to learn about on wikipedia, and it outputs the detailed search results on wikipedia with basic information (title, author, date) and URL.
